          Today's armed conflicts are marked by multiple armed actors, state

          the conflict parties to develop possible political alternatives for
          themselves that mitigate or remove the need for armed conflict. NOREF
          seeks to focus on a limited number of conflicts and areas of process
          support. This strategic narrowing stems from the conviction that any

          Communication
        </h3>
        <p class="flex self-start max-w-xl">
          An armed conflict always entails a war of words. During years of
          fighting the parties to a conflict build up extensive arsenals of
          scathing rhetoric. For peace and reconciliation to take place, but the
          verbal attacks must also cease. However, if old narratives are
          abandoned overnight, constituencies may lose touch with their
          leadership, increasing the risk of break-away factions and spoilers
          and also of the loss of support for the overall peace process among
          the broader public. This issue is a joint challenge faced by the
          parties, and recent experience has shown the importance of using
          communication in peace processes strategically, both jointly by the
          conflict parties and by each separately. Sound approaches can
          considerably enhance the legitimacy – and therefore the success – of
          the negotiations. Social media have become a game changer with respect
          to communication in peace processes. However, they constitute a
          doubled-edged sword that challenges confidentiality requirements and
          can easily become a vehicle for leaks, but is also an effective
          instrument for inclusive engagement in building public support for a
          peace process. NOREF has recognised the significance and complexities
          of communication in peace processes and is enhancing its capacities to
          contribute with assessments, strategic advice and operational support
          across its projects, as needed.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl tracking-tight font-semibold sm:text-lg py-4">
          Gender and inclusivity
        </h3>

        <p class="flex self-start max-w-xl">
          Victims in war, neglected in peace: this is a common fate of women,
          youth, indigenous peoples, and minorities in both ongoing armed
          conflicts and post-conflict societies. Peace processes often focus
          narrowly on ending violence, without addressing the underlying social,
          economic and political causes of the conflict. As a result, the voices
          of the excluded often go unheard. NOREF strives to create a space at
          the negotiating table for those who have been excluded, be it women,
          youth, minorities or civil society. In order for their participation
          to be meaningful, the Centre helps to advise groups and communities to
          prepare articulate demands and effectively represent their
          constituencies. There is also room for improvement in terms of gender
          and inclusivity in the field of international mediation. NOREF
          believes that if more women take on central mediation roles, they will
          in turn push for more inclusive peace processes.

          Military dialogue
        </h3>
        <p class="flex self-start max-w-xl">
          In many cases a country’s armed forces are aligned with the more
          conservative social and political actors, and often perceive
          themselves as the guardians of national stability. However, this will
          sometimes lead to resistance among members of the military to
          political and social changes, including peace and reconciliation with
          informal armed groups. The change from armed conflict to peace will
          inevitably lead to some fundamental changes in the military. What will
          be the armed forces’ main assignment when internal counter-insurgency
          is no longer needed? How will transitional justice affect soldiers and
          officers, or indeed the armed forces’ own self-identity and esprit de
          corps? NOREF’s military dialogue programme creates a safe space for
          high-ranking officers to discuss sensitive issues regarding the peace
          process. It also provides a meeting place with actors whom members of
          the military have often associated with their opponent, including
          human rights organisations, journalists and politicians. International
          experts are brought in to provide fresh perspectives and expertise on
          issues such as transitional justice, security sector reform, gender
          and inclusivity. NOREF started working on military dialogue in
          Colombia in 2014. The programme, in partnership with the Colombian
          organisation that runs it – Social Development Group – will continue
          as the peace deal with the FARC is implemented and the peace
          negotiations with the ELN proceed. The experience of the Colombia
          project is being shared with other processes NOREF is engaged in.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl tracking-tight font-semibold sm:text-lg py-4">
          Ceasefire and monitoring
        </h3>

        <p class="flex self-start max-w-xl">
          Designing and implementing ceasefires and how they are to be
          monitored, and compliance with all the elements of such protocols, are
          critical to all peace negotiations. NOREF is steadily building a
          long-term capacity to supplement existing Norwegian technical and
          operational expertise in this area. The aim is to provide both formal
          and informal mediation processes with tailor-made support on
          ceasefires and ceasefire monitoring. This capacity is already
          operational in the Philippines through the provision of expert support
          to both the Bangsamoro peace process and to that between the
          Government of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front of the
          Philippines.
